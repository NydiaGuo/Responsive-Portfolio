			<!--add more about me-->
			<p>	Thank you for reading my profolio! My major is business, so this is the major requirement class I have to take. Actually, I have taken online classes before, since my schedule can work well if I take it online. Yet, no garden without weeds. The good things about online classes are you can save the transportation fee, time and fit your schedules. On the other side, you need to discipline yourself and work on your own in order to finish assignments on time, you may not get the feedback right away from the professors.

			<p>	&nbsp; &nbsp; I like to play badminton and hike. Be honest, I do not workout a lot, but I usually will play badminton 2-4 hours at least once or twice a week. Just as the old saying “Life is a movement!” Because when you have a healthy body, you have everything.
